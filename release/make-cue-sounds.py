"""Generate the mod's own cue sounds into a directory.

Why these are generated rather than shipped as files
----------------------------------------------------
Every other sound this mod plays is one the game already owns, chosen by
a cvar, so a player can read the path and know exactly what they are
hearing. These cannot work that way: ET's sound set is combat and
world effects, almost all of it one-shot transients with sharp onsets,
and a beacon that loops needs the opposite - sustained or sparse, soft
at the edges, and seamless at the loop point. Nothing in the game fits.

So they are synthesised, and the synthesis lives here as source rather
than as opaque binaries in the repository. Anyone can read what
each sound is made of, change a number and hear the difference.

What the constraints actually are
---------------------------------
  * Mono, 22050 Hz, 16-bit. The engine positions a mono source in 3D
    itself; a stereo file throws that away and the cue stops pointing
    anywhere.
  * Seamless. Each file is one whole loop cycle and both ends sit at
    zero, so the repeat is inaudible.
  * Localisable. A pure low tone is heard but not placed - the ear needs
    high-frequency content to tell front from back. Every tone here
    carries harmonics for that reason alone.
  * Bearable. These run continuously. Sparse duty cycles, soft onsets,
    nothing percussive.

Deterministic: same input, same bytes. The build checks that.

Usage
-----
    ./make-cue-sounds.py <output-directory>
    ./make-cue-sounds.py --preview <output-directory>

--preview writes each sound looped end to end for about six seconds,
the way the game plays it, for listening to outside the game. One loop
of the crosshair tick is a fifth of a second - too short to judge.
